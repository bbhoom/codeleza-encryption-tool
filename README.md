# encryption-tool

This project mainly focuses on the development of an application program to encrypt or decrypt messages as required by the user. This program makes it convenient for users to make their own keys to encrypt their messages for secret conversations. 
The features of the project include the ability to create user defined keys which allow one to curate oneâ€™s own languages. Users have the ability to create their own account with password protection and save their languages.
The admin creates a database consisting of 3 tables: Users, Languages& Language-Keys. Users can use the language of their choice using a simple and efficient interface. All this has been achieved through the efficient extraction and injection of data in the database
Concepts in Python and MySQL were used to develop the application.(SQL Tables are necessary for the working of this project)
